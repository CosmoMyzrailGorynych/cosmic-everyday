<p>Cosmic Everyday is a personal organizer and&nbsp;an&nbsp;all-in-one tool to&nbsp;<strong>make the&nbsp;process of&nbsp;creating your personal
        projects spectacular</strong>. It&nbsp;allows you to&nbsp;plan, track and complete your projects.</p>
<p>It&nbsp;doesn't position itself as&nbsp;a&nbsp;collaboration tool like Trello, though some of&nbsp;that&nbsp;features will be added soon.
    Instead, it&nbsp;encourages creativity and allows you to&nbsp;make better content by&nbsp;maximizing your own productivity.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Organize your coding projects, a&nbsp;roadmap for a&nbsp;blog, a&nbsp;youtube channel calendar,
        lectures and&nbsp;study tasks, daily chores, or&nbsp;virtually anything;</li>
    <li>Create notebooks, write stuff on&nbsp;cards, tag them with&nbsp;labels, organize everything in&nbsp;lists and observe your
        project as&nbsp;a&nbsp;whole at&nbsp;a&nbsp;glance;</li>
    <li>Keep track of important events with automatic agenda that is&nbsp;based on your cards;</li>
    <li>Write notes, add quick tasks, or start blog posts and other&nbsp;long-form documents with built-in editor. Add images
        and other&nbsp;attachments when words aren't enough;</li>
    <li>Gather all your projects in&nbsp;one&nbsp;place: be&nbsp;it&nbsp;on Trello, Github, Gitlab or from&nbsp;somewhere else.
        <em>SOON: agenda integration with popular services.</em></li>
</ul>

    As a Cosmic Everyday's developer I believe, that work tools must be accessible for
    everyone. I can't make 3DSMax or Photoshop free, but I can help you stay productive with my app.

<h2>Differences between&nbsp;0.6&nbsp;and&nbsp;1.0</h2>
<ol>
    <li><strong>v1.0 and 0.6 are not compatible</strong>. There is no migration process, at least for now. Their DBs and
        data formats are different to support each other directly.</li>
    <li>You can switch to 0.6 and back at any time, but you won't be able to run both of them simultaneously. v0.6 will
        show a warning message about a different profile version, though.</li>
    <li>v1.0 aims to recombine old tools around the concept of notebooks, removing unneeded clutter. Currently, only
        Docker and some Jumbles features are integrated, with time tracker being in production. This means that there is
        neither Painter nor Calendar views at the moment.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Btw</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Current build includes <strong>English, Brazilian Portuguese, Italian, French and Russian language
        support.</strong></li>
    <li>This app is maintained by one student, so donations will be very useful :)</li>
